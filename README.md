# find_basophilia
Hey there! I hope this finds you well :).

This program highlights cell structures (nuclei or basophils), to facilitate  its visualization and subsequent identification. The main in this program allows to highlight the "sufficiently red" and "sufficiently blue" pixels (which often make up the purple color in RGB) in the image and turns to grayscale all other pixels in the image to highlight the basophilia present in the image.

Highlight notes: 

1) Kindly create a subfolder in the folder you are going to run this program under the name "images", in here there are 7 test images (BS1 - BS7) of references to run my extension for this program (find_basophilia).
2) Make sure to install "Pillow" with your PIP feature through your CMD. You can use it as a reference: "pip install Pillow".
