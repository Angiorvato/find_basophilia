Hey there! I hope this finds you well.

If you are interested in science or do you like cells in general I think you would like this. 

This really short program highlights cell structures (nuclei or basophilia), to facilitate its visualization and subsequent identification. 

How is it achieved? Easy, it allows to highlight the "sufficiently red" and "sufficiently blue" pixels (which often make up the purple color in RGB) in the image and turns to grayscale all other pixels in the image to highlight the "basophilia" present in the image.

Highlight notes: 

1) Kindly create a subfolder in the mainfolder you are going to run this program under the name "images", so you can add the 7 test images (BS1 - BS7) to test it.
2) Make sure to install "Pillow" through your CMD. A reference:

pip install Pillow

3) The find_basophilia.py file includes #comments in English AND Spanish üòÅ.
