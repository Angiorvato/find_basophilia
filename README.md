Hey there! I hope this finds you well.

If you are interested in science or do you like cells in general I think you would like this. This program highlights cell structures (nuclei or basophils), to facilitate its visualization and subsequent identification. In short, the main in this program allows to highlight the "sufficiently red" and "sufficiently blue" pixels (which often make up the purple color in RGB) in the image and turns to grayscale all other pixels in the image to highlight the basophilia present in the image.

Highlight notes: 

1) Kindly create a subfolder in the folder you are going to run this program under the name "images", so you can add the 7 test images (BS1 - BS7) to it as references to run the extension for this program (find_basophilia).
2) Make sure to install "Pillow" with your PIP feature through your CMD. You can use it as a reference: "pip install Pillow".
3) The find_basophilia.py file includes #comments in English AND Spanish, to make everything easier.
